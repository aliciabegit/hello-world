# hello-world
This repo contains files from my work on the udacity intro to programming nanodegree

Background info: 
I studied all the wrong things in college and was ill-prepared for graduate school. I'm learning to code and my own now. Boy does it feel good to learn new skills. Currently I'm doing the Udacity Intro to Programming Nanodegree.
